# EX24: More Practice

* ### 例子：

  ```python
  print("Let's practice everything.")
  print('You\'d need to know \'bout escapes with \\ that do:')
  print('\n newlines and \t tabs.')
  
  poem = """
  \tThe lovely world
  with logic so firmly planted
  cannot discern \n the needs of love
  nor comprehend passion from intuition
  and requires an explanation
  \n\t\twhere there is none.
  """
  
  print("-----------")
  print(poem)
  print("-----------")
  
  five = 10 - 2 + 3 - 6
  print(f"This should be five: {five}")
  
  def secret_formula(started):
      jelly_beans = started * 500
      jars = jelly_beans / 1000
      crates = jars / 100
      return jelly_beans, jars, crates
  
  start_point = 10000
  beans, jars, crates = secret_formula(start_point)
  
  # remember that this is another way to format a string
  print("With a starting point of: {}".format(start_point))
  # it's just like with an f"" string
  print(f"We'd have {beans} beans, {jars} jars, and {crates} crates.")
  
  start_point = start_point / 10
  
  print("We can also do that this way:")
  formula = secret_formula(start_point)
  # this is an easy way to apply a list to a format string
  print("We'd have {} beans, {} jars, and {} crates.".format(*formula))
  
  # print(type(formula))
  ```
  
  `.format(*formula)`：在ex8.py中有提到过，`print(type(formula))`输出结果是`<class 'tuple'>`，所以相当于使用`*`元组传递参数。
  
  结果：
  
  ```powershell
  You'd need to know 'bout escapes with \ that do:
  
   newlines and    tabs.
  -----------
  
          The lovely world
  with logic so firmly planted
  cannot discern
   the needs of love
  nor comprehend passion from intuition
  and requires an explanation
  
                  where there is none.
  
  -----------
  This should be five: 5
  With a starting point of: 10000
  We'd have 5000000 beans, 5000.0 jars, and 50.0 crates.
  We can also do that this way:
  We'd have 500000.0 beans, 500.0 jars, and 5.0 crates.
  ```
